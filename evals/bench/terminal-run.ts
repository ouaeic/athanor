/**
 * The orchestration a Terminal-Bench score needs, and nothing else.
 *
 * `score.ts` drives one task through a real `AgentWorker` against the shim and takes its verdict
 * from the box. It deliberately does not know how a box comes to exist: `backend.ts` says the
 * container "is created by the benchmark's own task definition, which is the only thing that knows
 * the image, the network mode and the verifier's expectations". This file is that thing.
 *
 * Per task, in order: start a container from the image built for it, hand `scoreTask` a factory
 * that attaches a backend to it, stage the tests for the already-solved guard, take them out again
 * before the turn can see them, put them back for the verdict, and remove the container. The
 * staging dance is not tidiness - it is the only arrangement in which BOTH of the two rules hold.
 * @see the `staging` parameter of `scoreTask`.
